### US Apiculture and honey production
##### Matt & Sean

We examine the historic honey-producing bee colony counts, yield, and honey production of states as [collected by the USDA](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Bee_and_Honey/), finding statistical evidence for regional "clustering" of production and a negative correlation between per-hive yield and overall price, most strongly reflected in states with the greatest absolute production
